# TEDx Asheville
## Problem
Asheville needed a platform for "ideas worth spreading," but managing a volunteer-run, high-production event is chaotic.

## Move
Co-founded and led Technical Production since 2009. Built a repeatable system for speaker coaching, stage management, and video production.

## Result
*   Over a decade of sold-out events.
*   Millions of views on YouTube.
*   A thriving local community of innovators.
