# The 2-Hour Strategy Session

A focused "pull-out session" to dissolve confusion and build a concrete plan.

## The Problem
You have a vision, a team, and momentum, but you're hitting a wall of complexity. You need a fresh pair of eyes to help you see the "unseen" blocks.

## The Solution
We spend 2 hours deep-diving into your current state.
*   I ask questions.
*   I extract reality.
*   We map the territory together.

## The Deliverable
You leave with:
1.  **A 1-page Action Plan**.
2.  **Clarity on your next 3 moves**.
3.  **A recording of our session**.

## Who Is This For?
Founders and Product Leaders who are ready to stop spinning and start shipping.
