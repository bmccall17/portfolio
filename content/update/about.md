# About Brett A McCall

I am a product leader who focuses on **outcomes** and **legibility**.

My work bridges the gap between technical complexity and human connection. I don't just "manage products"; I build systems that allow teams to ship valuable, impactful software.

## What I Do

1.  **Product Leadership**: I lead cross-functional teams to clarity and execution.
2.  **Technical Strategy**: I translate business needs into technical reality.
3.  **Immersive Collaboration**: I design tools that help people think together better.

## For Whom

I work with mission-driven startups (Seed to Series B) who are reimagining how we learn and collaborate.

## Outcomes

*   **Clarity**: No more "visionary" fluff. Concrete roadmaps.
*   **Velocity**: We ship.
*   **Impact**: We measure what matters.
