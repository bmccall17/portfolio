# Antigravity Setup & Integration Report

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Project**: `/home/bam/projects/portfolio`
**Status**: ACTIVE

## 1. Configuration Installed
I have successfully established the Antigravity Brain in your portfolio repository.

-   **Portfolio Rules**: Installed at `.agent/ANTIGRAVITY_RULES_PORTFOLIO.md`.
    -   *Customization*: Added "Project Customizations" section (Hugo/Stack preferences).
    -   *Protocol*: Added "Tradeoffs & Permissions" section.
-   **Workflows**:
    -   `feature_implementation.md`
    -   `design_audit.md`
    -   `release_prep.md`

## 2. Document Analysis (Requested Review)
I reviewed your existing documentation to suggest alignment edits.

### `DESIGN_AUDIT.md`
-   **Status**: **EXCELLENT / COMPLIANT**.
-   **Analysis**: This document is comprehensive, rigorously structured, and fully aligns with standard Accessibility/UX audits. It uses a clear "Priority/Issue/Fix" schema that matches my internal templates.
-   **Suggestion**: No structure changes needed. I will simply append new findings to this file during future audits.

### `SHIP_LOG.md`
-   **Status**: **COMPLIANT**.
-   **Analysis**: Follows the "Keep a Changelog" standard and Semantic Versioning perfectly.
-   **Suggestion**: Keep exactly as is. My `release_prep` workflow is already configured to update this format.

## 3. Ready for "Full Tilt"
Antigravity is now fully integrated with Level 1 (Observer) default permissions. You can switch me to Level 2 (Contributor) or Level 3 (Lead) by stating your intent at the start of our coding sessions.

### Recommended Next Command
> "Antigravity, let's start with a Level 2 session. I want to tackle the 'Priority: HIGH' Accessibility issues from the Design Audit."
